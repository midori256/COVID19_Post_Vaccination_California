# COVID19_Post_Vaccination_California

"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying vaccination status of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by analyzing the state immunization registry and registry of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Post-vaccination cases are individuals who have a positive SARS-Cov-2 molecular test (e.g. PCR) at least 14 days after they have completed their primary vaccination series or 14 days after they have completed their booster or additional dose."
