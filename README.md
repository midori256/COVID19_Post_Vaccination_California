# COVID19_Post_Vaccination_California

"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying vaccination status of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by analyzing the state immunization registry and registry of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Post-vaccination cases are individuals who have a positive SARS-Cov-2 molecular test (e.g. PCR) at least 14 days after they have completed their primary vaccination series or 14 days after they have completed their booster or additional dose."

All data and data definition in this notebook are downloaded and referred from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data)

Some interesting findings:
- Number of unvaccinated COVID cases were higher than vaccinated and boosted status in general, except for Jan and Feb 2022.
- The percentage of unvaccinated COVID cases (in unvaccinated population) are higher than the percent of vaccinated or boosted cases. Which means if you are unvaccinated, you have higher chance of getting COVID than vaccinated or boosted people.
- Number of unvaccinated hospitalizations and deaths were always higher than vaccinated or boosted status.
